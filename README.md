# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game UI with PySide6

Welcome to the **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game UI** repository!  
This project showcases a simple, interactive, and visually appealing Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using **PySide6** - the official Python bindings for the Qt 6 framework.

## About the Game

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game played between two players, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

- **Rock** 
- **Paper** 
- **Scissors**

The rules are straightforward:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cut Paper
- Paper covers Rock

This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing this game against the computer, with an intuitive design and smooth user experience.
